IMPORTANT BUGS
- Need more complete track query.

IMPORTANT WORK
- Circuit train mode
- Special reservation/borrowing 'system'
- Re-calibrate
- Track train while it's stopping

Work:
- Run less often than every tick?
- Wait for random time in waiting state?
- Overshoot stops and send a reverse?
- Switching turnouts near but beyond end of path
- Make trains robust to broken switches

UI improvements:
- Output freezing for observation or copy-paste
- Full screen log display mode

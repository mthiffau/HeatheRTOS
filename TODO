IMPORTANT BUGS
- We double-compensate for reduced speeds in stopping distance.
- We don't adjust stopping curve coefficients given new calibration.
- We don't use estimate while stopping to correct position or drive.
- Need more complete track query.

IMPORTANT WORK
- Circuit train mode
- Special reservation/borrowing 'system'
- Re-calibrate
- Track train while it's stopping

Work:
- Run less often than every tick?
- Wait for random time in waiting state?
- Switching turnouts near but beyond end of path
- Checking availability of edges slightly past end of path in routing
- Make trains robust to broken switches
- [NO] Overshoot stops and send a reverse?

UI improvements:
- Output freezing for observation or copy-paste
- Full screen log display mode
- Graphical track display

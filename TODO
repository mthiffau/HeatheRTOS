Real work:
- Track train while it's stopping?
- Switching turnouts near but beyond end of path
- Track reservation, integrated with route finding

Bugs:
- UI status line is gone?

UI improvements:
- Output freezing for observation or copy-paste
- Full screen log display mode
- Graphical track display
